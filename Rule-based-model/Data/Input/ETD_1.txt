3 SOME ASPECTS OF RADIATION INDUCED NUCLEATION OF WATER by Chih-Ping Tso Submitted to the Department of Nuclear Engineering on August 11, 1970 in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science. ABSTRACT Experimental data for the determination of superheats of separately, fission fragments and fast neutrons in water were taken with an experimen- (2) tally modified set up of Bell: Attempts to correlate both data from present work and from Bell with theory led to apparent inadequacies with the theory. The theory is based on an "Energy Balance Method" developed by Bell. This method was also used to compute threshold superheat for (5) benzene, for later comparison with data from another investigator when this reference becomes available. Application of this Energy Balance Method to predict fission neutrons induced nucleation and alpha particles induced nucleation (alpha particles from (n,x) reaction on Boron) at Pressurised Water Reactor conditions indicated that radiation induced nucleation for monoenergetic neutrons and alphas present in reactor may be effective in causing initiation of nucleate boiling. However, detailed consideration of all neutron energies present (spectrum) was not accomplished to arrived at a definite conclu- sion for this reactor case. Thesis Supervisor Neil E.

10 Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Objectives The present project will study primarily the effect of radiation in inducing nucleation in water. The main goal of the project is to confirm or modify as necessary some of the conclusions of C.R. Bell's Doctorate Thesis (2) Basically, the experimental work consists of determination of threshold superheat of an oil-suspended water bubble at various pressure, when subjected separately to fission fragments and fast neutrons radiation. The objectives of this thesis are enunciated as follows:-- (i) To repeat some of the data points in Bell's work in order to make the following corrections to Bell's data and to compare with the valid- ity of Bell's analytical corrections. a) Correction on the apparatus in order to create an isothermal field around the water bubble. b) Correction on the apparatus in order to reduce a thermocouple thermal error present in Bell's work. c) Correction on a pressure gauge reading error, (ii) To apply Bell's theory, modified as necessary by the results of (i) above, to the high pressure range of the Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR) conditions. (iii) To compare the prediction of Bell's theory, modified as necessary to the results of (i) above, to some organic liquid data obtained by other investigators (13)(5) .

11 1.2 Background information on theory The amount of superheat a liquid could attain when heated beyond its saturation point depends on the substance properties as well as the environmental conditions of the system. The presence of radiation is likely to affect superheat owing to deposition of energy into the liquid with consequent increase in instability in the system. There are primarily two approaches to predict radiation induced nucleation. The Energy Balance Method requires that the energy of formation of a nucleus in water, Ef, be equal to the energy available from radiation for the formation of the nucleus, Ea. That is = (1.1) The Statistical Method which regards the situation from a micro- scopic viewpoint predicts that an additional energy term Es is involved, due to the extra energy given from the surrounding vapor to the nucleus. Es is dependent on the production rate of the number of energy transfer events to the nucleus. Equation (1.1) becomes (1.2) For a given pressure in the system, Ef decreases when the amount of superheat attainable in the system increases. Under idealized conditions, Ef decreases to a threshold minimum, with the corresponding superheat temperature being the Foam limit for the particular system pressure. Thus from equations (1.1) and (1.2), it is clear that for the same E2, the Energy Balance Method predicts a higher superheat than the Statis- tical Method. The differences, however, is small, and in this work the 
12.json
12 simpler Energy Balance Method will be used and Es neglected. 1.3 Experimental background A water bubble of about 1/2 in. diameter is suspended in oil to avoid cavities, and heated up by the oil to the point of boiling. The source of radiation used is a combination of five sealed one-Curie Pu-Be sources with neutron spectrum as given by Karaian (9). The total flux at the water bubble is about 0.53 x 104 neutron-sec-1. In the case of fission fragments in water, the same neutron source is used, except that a minute quantity of uranium nitrate is introduced in the water bubble. The concentration used is 0.0087 gm of UO2 (NO3)2 6H20 in one gm. of water, giving rise to a fission rate of about 2 events per minute in the water bubble.

13 Chapter 2 Experimental Considerations The reader is urged to consult Bell (2) for a fuller discussion of the experimental program. Here, the basic set-up is recapitulated with a description of apparatus modification, and the experimental results presented. 2.1 Experimental set-up Fig. 2.1 gives a diagrammatic representation of the apparatus. The water bubble X is suspended between the suspending oil H, a heavy mineral oil, and a layer of covering oil I, a "Dow Corning 550 Fluid" silicon oil. These fluids are contained in the cylindrical (10" x 3" dia) boiling chamber A which has tube fittings both at the covered flanged top, and at the closed bottom. Sticking out from A at the same level as the bubble is the observation window B through which nucleation of the bubble can be observed. Visibility is maintained by a flood lamp above the light window C. To compensate for heat loss from B to the surround- ing, there is a dummy window from the chamber sicrated diametrically opposite the observation window (not shown). Two main cooling devices exist in the boiling chamber. One is the condenser F which serves to condense residual water vapor in the air space left by previous boiling of the bubble. The condensate is collected in a container and is dischargeable via a line to the waste tank R. The other cooling device is the important convection generator G,

16 which is a hollow open-ended tube with a cooling coil, sitting at the bottom of the chamber as shown. In a heated chamber, a free convection current is generated which circulates the supporting oil such that the flow is radially towards the top of the generator, down through the tube, and radially out at the bottom. In this fashion, the bubble is kept in place radially in the boiling chambers. Vertically the bubble can be located by adjusting the oil levels. Both these cooling devices are fed by a supply water line I. The condenser cooling lines V are led in from the top while the convection generator cooling lines U from the the bottom of the chamber. The cover oil reservoir E stores oil to be introduced into the test region through the inlet J. Supporting mineral oil is introduced from the bottom of the chamber from the reservoir Q. 0 is an air cylinder for pressurizing the system. The pressure gauge P indicates the pressure in the chamber. 2.2 Apparatus modification In Bell's experiment, the position of the water bubble was kept about 1/8" above a thermocouple L projecting up through the convection generator G as shown in Fig. 2.1. The bubble temperature based on this singular thermocouple measurement was later found by Bell to be incorrect as there existed a temperature gradient in the field of the bubble confirmed by a temperature plot in this region with the aid of a movable thermocouple. Bell corrected the temperature measurements by subtracting 71°F from his data. This 71°F is based on an analysis in Bell's theses. Bell used only a circumferential heater M to heat the system. Since heat was lost from the chamber above the cover oil a temperature gradient existed in the cover oil and hence the water drops. To set up an 
17.json
17 isothermal region at the bubble a second circumferential heater N was added in this thesis to the upper part of the chamber. At the same time, a second thermocouple probe K(top) was installed to read the temperature at the top of the bubble. Both thermocouples were visible through the observation window. The Chromel-Alumel type thermocouple had been calibrated with reference to boiling water at atmospheric pressure. The readings were recorded to by a Minneapolis-Honeywell strip chart recorder. By switching connections to and fro, temperatures measured by top and bottom thermocouples were registered alternately on the strip chart to confirm isothermal bubble conditions. The latter was also checked periodically for accuracy with reference to a Leed and Northrup Type K-3 Universal potentiometer. With both heaters being adjustable in power, this arrangement led to good indication of an isothermal field when K and L were in close agreement. Another modification made was the material of the sheath of lower thermocouple L. This was formerly a 1/8" O/D, 1/16" I/D aluminum tubing with the thermocouple bead pushed against the closed upper end. In the course of preliminary investigation on the isothermal field around the bubble with a third thermocouple, it was found that at about 200F atmospheric pressure the third thermocouple while in the vicinity of the tip of L gave a reading of about 4°F higher than L. This was attributable to heat conduction down the sheath from the chamber to the exterior, producing a temperature difference between the thermocouple bead and the oil. Thermocouple thermal error is inevitable in such temperature measurement, but this case is particularly pronounced since the aluminum sheath with a high thermal conductivity of about 120 is embedded in oil of conductivity about 0.07

19 [ bru-br-1-ft-1.op-1 ] only. An attempt will be made to estimate the the error in Bell's data taken with the aluminum sheath in Chapter 4. The aluminum sheath was replaced by a stainless steel sheath which has a conductivity of about 10 and the thermal error at the same conditions was then down to with 1°F. It is noteworthy that the error is also sensitive to the convection generator flow rate, as the convective current encourages heat transfer through L. For the top thermocouple K, no appreciable error was detected though an aluminum sheath was used. Another modification was the way the water bubble was introduced to the chamber. Instead of an arrangement similar to the path E,2, J of Figure 2.1, the bubble was put in by a thin glass syringe through an entrance D. This eliminate unwanted water drops which often drained down into the oil chamber from the old arrangements in the course of the experiment. The 0 to 100 psig Bourdon pressure gauge P had been tested by a Refinery Supply Company Dead Weight Tester. The calibration graph, Fig. 2.2, shows that the gauge reads 3-4 psi too low. Bell found that the same gauge read 1-2 psi too high and corrected accordingly in his work. The implication of this will be discussed later on. 2.3 Experimental procedure A typical pressurized run will be described. After the apparatus was checked to be in running conditions, oil was filled in the chamber. With reference to Fig. 2.1 again, by closing valves 1 and 9 and opening valves 10 and 6 supporting oil was forced up the chamber. Covering oil flowed in by opening valve 2. After the water bubble was carefully 
20.json
20 put in at the oil interface, the chamber was pressurized to the required pressure by opening valves 9 and 10 and closing all other valves. Heaters M and N were then switched on and adjusted to maintain isother- mal spatial temperature field as the overall temperature rose on a reasonable temperature ramp as sensed by K and L. With valve 7 kept closed and valve 8 crack opened, a convection was generated, stabilizing the bubble. The system was then left to attain its superheat, attention being given to the heater adjustment and bubble position all the time. At a pre-determined temperature level close to but below the incipient boiling point (either by reference to Bell's results or by a trial run) the neutron source W was introduced and set close to the face of the chamber outter container. Henceforth, watchful work determined the superheat threshold of the bubble; a sudden burst or jump of the bubble being indicative of boiling. 2.4 Experimental difficulties A number of snags were encountered in the course of experimental work. Apart from the mechanical failures in the hardware, work was often delayed due to one of the following frustrating events. (i) The bubble boiled well before the expected temperature range because of foreign particles present inadvertently in the bubble. (ii) On occasions, it was necessary to change the supporting oil in the chamber as its density had been decreased through repeated heating, resulting in the bubble to submerge out of view. (iii) Owing to reasons still unknown, at high temperatures of about 400F and pressures above 50 psia, the bubble tended to drift out of sight to the side chamber wall, in spite of a strong convection generator 
21.json
21 (iv) Also at conditions of (iii), there is a tendancy for evaporation to take place from the bubble in the form of a stream of tiny steam bubbles rising upwards. A result is that the bubble is set into slight motion by the principle of momentum conservation, This may upset the super- heat threshold and may also make the threshold less distinguishable since at these higher temperatures and pressures the first indication of boiling is a weak quiver without the bubble breaking up. While (i) and (ii) are difficulties present for all experimental work, (iii) and (iv) are dominant only in the fast neutron runs. 2.5 Experimental Results of Present Work. Table 2.1 shows data obtained for the fission fragment induced boiling at four system pressures. Tsat is the saturation temperature of water at that pressure. It and To are the electromotive forces recorded at nucleation by the top and bottom thermocouples respectively, in millivolts. For chromel-alumel thermocouples, and with reference junction at 32°F, these electromotive forces are easily converted to OF from standard tables. The average superheat temperature is T, and the amount of superheat attained is A T. The mean values of each set of data are Imean and Tmean with the standard deviation for Tmean being b . . The values in parentheses are those from Bell's work on which more will be said in section 2.6. 'No. of trials' is the actual total number of experimental attempts made. Not all these attempts gave results because of experimental diffi- culties mentioned in section 2.4. And out of the 'no. of results' as tabulated in the table, some data represent cases where nucleation took place too early due to such factor as foreign bodies present. These 
22.json
22 cases are underlined in the table. The number of data not underlined is denoted by the item 'usuable results, and these are used to compute T mean and Tmean Table 2.2 shows data for the fast neutron case at two system pressures. They are much more difficult to obtain as stated in the previous section because of higher experimental superheats at the same pressure. TRt is the temperature ramp in °F/min as recorded by the top thermocouple, and TRB by the bottom thermocouple, giving an average value of TR. For a system pressure of 55 psia, the TR had been obtained by taking the temperature trace on the strip chart recorder for the last one minute history before boiling occurred. This criteria, even though is now believed incorrect (compared to the one that will be mentioned in the next paragraph) is used here because the traces obtained in the experiment for 55 psia could not be interpreted in the other way. Only the last minute ramps were fairly constant. (2,p.168 ) For a system pressure of 75 psia, Fig. VI.6 of Bell showed that for 'a' at and below 12, there is a threshold superheat of about 77°F below which there is not likely to be any boiling event at any finite TR. Bell (2,p.151 ) showed that above about 77°F, the boiling event is a function of the TR from that superheat (of 77°F) up to boiling. The plots in Bell's Fig. VI.6 were actually obtained based on a constant TR for each boiling event (for a particular 'a'). Thus if experimental results were to be compared with theory (Bell's Fig. VI.6), the experimental results should best have a constant TR from A T around 77°F. This corresponds to an electromotive force of about 8.00 mv on the chart. In table 2.2 for 75 psia pressure, only the runs with TR 1.70 and 5.50 F/min have fairly constant ramps as woll as being constant from 8.00 mv onwards. The run 
23.json
23 of TR 0.41 °F/min has a constant ramp about 10°F too late or at about 88°F. The experimental charts are kept with N.E.

27 2.6 Re-interpretation of Bell's Data The one condition Bell made on his own data is that due to non-isother- mal field and this he did by an analysis which resulted in subtracting 7.5°F from the superheat threshold temperatures he obtained. In this thesis, this effect was corrected by addition of heaters to create an isothermal field. However, since several changes were simulta- neously made in the apparatus and data, it appears prudent to to re-inter- pret Bell's data by identifying each correction independently. Thus, we have three corrections on AT and one correction on TR (temperature ramp) as follows:- AT - correction(i). Bubble in Bell's runs was not in an isothermal field AT - correction (ii). Thermocouple sheath error. Bell's data was recorded by a thermocouple reading lower than 'true.' AT - correction (iii). Pressure gauge reading difference of 5 psia as mentioned earlier. TR - correction(i), In the case of fast neutrons in water, the temperature ramps reported by Bell are based on varying lengths of time and temperature intervals before boiling. As mentioned in section 2.5, it is now thought more accurate to base the TR on an average basis (provided TR variation is not too drastic) from the temperature recording of about 8.00 mv or T of 77°F (see section 2.5) onwards. (This 8.00 mv is only applicable for 75psia system pressure). Hence the TR should be re-interpreted, if necessary, from Bell's experimental charts. (22) 2.6.1 Fast neutrons. Table 2.3 presents a re-interpretation of Bell's data for fast neutrons in water at 75 psia system pressure. Similar tables could be compiled from Bell's temperature charts for 55 psia and 95 psia,

33 Chapter 3 Theoretical Considerations 3.1 The Energy Balance equation (2, p.62 ) Bell postulated that a roughly cylindrical length of vapor would be formed along the radiation path in water due to energy deposition to the water.

Bell theorised that ) mi a, a constant of 6.07 based on a certain criteria for spherical nucleation (2,p.198 ) The energy of formation of an embryo is made up of several components.

The change in free energy can be represented (2, p.69 ) by the term .

With reference to Fig. 3.2, b = (3.1) where Pl and Pg are the liquid and gas pressure respectively, and in units of [1bf-ft-2]. The energy losses by way of dissociation of water due to radiation can be approximated (2, p.124) by the expression QAE G(H2) 106 N EMBRYO where Q = 90.3 (Kcal) (mole H2) P,* Pe Pg DE = Energy available from radiation p* (H2) = yield = 1.8 (molecules) (100ev-1) = Avogadro's number If we now neglect the energy of 6 expansion losses from the hot cylinder by way of heat conduction and viscous (19) flow , equation (1.1) may be written Fig. 3.2 Equilibrium of a critical embryo

The energy deposition to water through nuclear elastic collisions has also been neglected. (2, p.117) The corresponding equation (3.8) after integrating and inserting the appropriate unit conversion factors, is [E(4)) - 95 Mor] - 2 = at Pe (3.440x10+) 61.75 - - pr+Pg-Pl - (3.11) Note that in equation (3.11), use is made of equation (3.6), and that b is in [ lbf-ft -1 1, P1 in [ 1b-ft"3 , and pressures in ( 1bf-ft-21. Bell has developed a computer program to calculate the superheat threshold in the pressure range of atmospheric to 100 psia, the details of which are found in his work. (2, p.122) Basically it is an iterative process to find a system temperature that satisfies equation (3.10) and (3.6). The final results involve three variable, viz., the system pressure P1, the system temperature T1 and the parameter a, with a and

39 P1 considered independent variables. The theoretical results are plotted and compared with experimental data in Chapter 5. It is noteworthy that the above iterative process requires the physical properties (vapor pressure, liquid and vapor densities, surface tension, and enthalpy change by evaporation) of water to be known over the pressure (and hence temperature) range considered. These have been obtained conveniently through empirical relations as given in Appendix C. A typical computer program for the above calculations is included in Appendix F. The program is for fission neutrons in water at PWR conditions, but the fission fragment programs are very similar to it. 3.4 Fast Neutrons in Water at Low Pressure Range In the case of the Pu-Be neutrons in water, the main mechanism of energy loss to the water is by way of primary knock-on oxygen atom (PKOA) in water. The energy of a PKOA, J , can be expressed by the usual elastic scattering (7)as theory J = (3.12) where En is the neutron energy, A the atomic weight of oxygen, and the angle the neutron is scattered in the Center of Mass frame of reference. For a maximum J, J max = 0,22En = (3.13) The energy loss in this case is, from equation (3.9) with Z1 = 8, My = 16,

The primary knock-on energy of protons in water has been shown by Bell (2, p.252) to be of less importance because of the relatively low energy deposition rate. Calculations leading to equations (3.14) and (3.15) are given in Appendix E. It might be thought that J in equation (3.15) is simply J of max equation (3.13), with In being the maximum energy of the Pu-Be neutron spectrum. But, because of the low number of neutrons at the high energy tail, whether the highest energy neutrons are effective in causing nuclea- tion would depend on the experimental conditions. The production rate of highest energy PKOA depends on the intensity of the neutron source as well as on the temperature ramp of the system. For the present experimental conditions, Bell has developed a theore- tical relationship between the mininum participating primary knock-on energy (that primary knock-on energy at and above which will contribute to nucleation) and the temperature ramp of the system. For a temperature ramp of 1°F/min, as is aimed for in the experimental work, this minimum participating primary knock-on energy is 2.12 Mev. Thus J = 2.12 Mev in equation (3.14). 
41.json
41 As in the fission fragment case, Bell has calculated the superheat threshold over the range of atmospheric pressure to 100 psia, for various values of a. The same empirical formulae for physical properties of water are used. The theoretical results are plotted and compared with experimental data in Chapter 5. 3.5 Application of Theory to Radiation Induced Nucleation in PWR's 3.5.1 Fission Neutrons in Water under PWR Conditions. In an attempt to study radiation induced nucleation in the PWR, radiation induced by the fission neutrons is first considered. The same energy depostion rate expression and energy balance equation as used in section 3.4 is applicable here. However, two of the empirical formulae for physical properties of water (enthalpy change by evaporation and surface tension) must be altered to accommodate pressure in the region of 2235 psia. This is done in Appendix d. The fission spectrum, as given in Glasstone and Sesonske (7) or Kaplan has an energy distribution between 0.025 Mev and 17 Mev with (10) a maximum in number at around 1 Mev. This distribution is assumed to prevail in the coolant in contact with the fuel elements in the PWR by neglecting any effects the thin cladding material may have on the fission spectrum. An immediate difficulty in applying the theory developed so far to predict radiation induced nucleation is to decide what value of J to use in equation (3.15). The minimum primary knock-on energy cannot be determined as mentioned in section 3.4 because there is essentially zero temperature ramp in the steady-state PWR, and the theory would argue nucleation at the saturation temperature in all cases. This difficulty

43 has not been resolved in the present work. Nonetheless, to have some idea of how the energy of the neutrons would affect nucleation in the PWR, Bell's program is again used. A typical program run is given on Appendix F. Table 3.1 tabulates results for three cases--threshold superheat for 17 Mev neutrons with a = 3.70 and a = 6.07, and for 9.55 Mev neutrons with a = 6.07. These results will be plotted and discussed in Chapter 5. 3.5.2 Neutron Induced Alpha Particles in Water under PWR Conditions, Another possible source of radiation which induces nucleation in the PWR coolant is the (n, a ) reaction on Boron, the latter being added in the form of boric acid for chemical shim control in the PWR. The reaction is exothermic. + + + The energy deposition to water is here considered to be due to the alpha particles emitting from the (n,a) reaction. Hence equation (3.9) is again applicable, and is calculated (with Z1 = 2, M1 = 4) to be dE ds = P1 5.090 x 103 in 3.5495E (3.16) where again the energy deposition to protons has been neglected. Equation (3.7) becomes = ao Ce (4.97x103) - + 0.267 [ E(A1)-E(A2)] - * - P (3.17)

44 With equation (3.16) and (3.17), a computer program very similar to that used in section 3.5.1 and given in Appendix F may be used to find the threshold superheats, provided suitable values for E(s1) are taken. Here one is confronted with exactly the same difficulty as mentioned in section 3.5.1. From Evans (6) the kinetic energy of the alpha particle, E3, may be expressed as = M3+M4 cos e +1 M,Mal E, COSO + M4Q + E, (M4-M.) - (M3+ MA) 2 (M3 + MA) (3.18) where M, Ey = rest mass and kinetic energy of incident neutron M3 = rest mass of alpha particle M1 = rest mass of 3147 Q = "Q" value of the reaction = +2.793 Mev e = exit angle made by alpha particle with direction of incident neutron measured in the Laboratory frame of reference. The relationship between E3 and E1 is plotted on Fig. 3.3, showing the two extremes of 0 = T/2 and e = 0, corresponding to minimum and maximum energy transfers respectively. To have some idea of how this (n, a ) phenomenon could affect nucleation in the PWR, throe specific cases are considered--nucleation due to the action of 17 Mev, 1 Mev, and 0.025 Mev neutrons. From Fig. 3.3, the alpha particles energies corres- ponding to the maximum energy transfer of Q = 0 are 17.3 Mev, 2.95 Mev

In the course of a literature survey, it was found that other investigators had worked on radiation induced nucleation in some organic liquids. Becker (1) worked on diethyl ether, and E1-Nagdy (5 ) considered neutron-induced nucleation for 2.45 and 14.1 Mev in acetone and in benzene. It was decided then to apply Bell's theory to such liquids and compare the results with these investigators. However, within the limited time for the present thesis work, only the physical properties of benzene were completely obtained for use in calculating threshold superheats. This section will consider neutron induced nucleation in pure benzene in the pressure region of 0 to 100 psia. The benzene ring structure, being composed of covalently bonded C6HG, may for the present purpose considered free carbon and hydrogen atoms. The bond energy of each member atom is of the order below an ev. The main mechanism of energy loss by neutrons in benzene is by primary knock-on carbon atoms (PKCA) in benzene. The energy of a PKCA Jc, can be evaluated with equation (3.12) to be Dc = 0.142En (1-cos o) Maximised with respect to o, Jc = 0.284En (3.19)

48 En is again the neutron energy used. The energy loss of the PKCA in benzene can again be found by equation (3.9) by taking Z1 = 6, My = 12, and summing over i = 6c and 6H. The final result is = x In 0.9450E) + 10.5 E In 1230E Again to a good approximation, the energy loss to protons may be neglected (i.e. i = 6c only). Then, dE ds = 21 1.025 = x 104 in 0.9450E (3.20) Equation (3.8) becomes [E(42) - J.J = as Ce (1.000x104) JelnJ-E(A1)E(A)-1.0565[ J-E(A)] - - - P*+Pg- - Pp (3.21) Mononergetic neutrons of energies 2.45 Mev and 14.1 Mev are separately considered here (as per Becker ( 1 >) so that J, C from equation (3.19) are simply 0.695 Mev and 4.00 Mev respectively. Using a modified Bell's program, the threshold superheats for benzene for the above two neutrons energies were obtained, as a function of the 'a". A typical program run is found in Appendix F. Physical properties of benzene over the required pressure range is given in Appendix D. Fig. 3.4 and Fig. 3.5 show the results. The spread in the curves for 2.45 Mev neutrons as in Fig. 3.4 seems to be very narrow, with respect to values of a. In contrast, in Fig. 3.5,

Higher values of a did not yield any result from the computer program. These behaviors are not understood at present and further investigation is necessary.

52 Chapter 4 Thermocouple Correction An attempt will be made here to assess the temperature error present when the bottom thermocouple sheath is of aluminum and of stainless steel material. The analysis is based on an article by Rizika and Rohsenow (16) The assumption made are that the system is in steady state, the thermal conductivity k and the film coefficient of heat transfer h of the sheath are uniform and constant, and the end effects of the sheath are negligible, and the oil in the chamber has uniform temperature (see Fig. 4.3). These are valid since a more uniform thermal field is created in the oil by the addition of the top circumferential heater. 4.1 Analysis of Problem Fig. 4.1 shows the thermocouple sheath of length 1, submerged in supporting oil in length li. Considering the heat balance on an elementa- ry length dx with outside surface area dA, ((dA)=q(x+ x) - q(x) = (4.1) Now, = conduction law with S being the cross- sectional area of the sheath. Therefore, q(x + dx) = -kS 1/2 (T + And in air, q (dA) = no (T_-T)Pdx, while in oil, q (dA) = h;(Tr-T)Pdx, where no is the film coefficient of heat transfer between the air and the sheath, hi the total coefficient of heat transfer between the oil and the sheath, P is the perimeter of the sheath, and Ta, If are the temperatures of the ambient air and oil respectively, These equations may be

The evaluation of these coefficients involves property values of the oil which are functions of temperature, as well as T, so that a trial and error method is imperative.

56 Two levels of temperature will be considered, namely 300F and 400F corresponding respectively to the temperature ranges of the fission fragment and the fast neutron cases considered in Chapter 2. (i) hc. The film coefficient of heat transfer between the oil and the sheath. According to p.172 equation (7-4b) of McAdam (12) the expression for free convection over vertical cylinderw in laminar regime is given by Nu = 0.59(GrPr) (4.7) where Nu is the Nusselt number, Gr the Grashof number and Pr the Prandtl number. Equation (4.7) may be written as = liptyp 3 AT 1/4 Pr (4.8) Ms where ¹i is again the length of sheath in oil, k the thermal conductivity of oil, P1 the oil density, g the acceleration due to gravity, B the coefficient of volumetric expansion and Ms the oil viscosity. Table 4.1 tabulates these values for In the 300F region, equation (4.8) reduces to he = (4.9) and in the 400°F region, hc=13.8(A: = T) (4.10)

59 4.3 Evaluation of error. An assumed value for AT is taken as 1, 5, 10 and 20°F for each of the two temperature regions. he is thus evaluated with results shown in Table 4.2, using equations (4.9) and (4.10). In calculating hy from equation (4.11), equal intervals of temperatures are taken above and below 300F (or 400°F) for Tf and Tj. From Table 4.2, it is seen that hr is a weak function of A T. hi, the total coefficient of heat transfer between the oil and the sheath, equals the sum of he and hr.

60 Fig. 4. 4 and Fig. 4. 5 show plots of the assumed A T against the predicted A T. The intersections of these curves with the 45° lines indicate that for the aluminum sheath, there is an inherent error of about 11°F to be added to the experimental thermocouple readings. Based on the above model, the error seems to be fairly insensitive to the system temper- ature over the temperature region considered. For the stainless steel case, the errors are well below 1°F and hence are not of any concern.

63 Chapter 5 Conclusions and Recommendations 5.1 Conclusions 5.1.1 Fission Fragments in Water. Fig. 51 shows a comparison of theoretical and experimental superheat thresholds for fission fragments in water, with data taken from Tables 2.1 and 2.4. Data from present work indicate a value of a = 3.5 to 4.5. This data from the present work is most reliable since a) All the known errors in the experimental set up were corrected, and b) There were no special difficulties in performing this experiment (see section 2.4) so that sufficient data were collected at each system pressure. Therefore, if "a" were to be accepted as constant, a value of a = 3.7 seems appropriate. In considering the atmospheric pressure run, the closeness of present work data, O , and Bell raw, A , may be an indication that the A T-corrections(i) and (ii) (isothermal and thermocouple sheath) cancol off each other very nearly. This supports the thermocouple error analysis result of plus = 11°F and Bell's isothermal correction of minus a 7.5°F. However, in the other three runs where a pressure gauge was used, the A T-correction (iii) (gauge) do not seem to support the above. Perhaps the basis of the 5 psia gauge correction to Bell's raw data is question- able.

68 5.1.2 Fast Neutrons in Water. As there are many uncertainties in the fast neutron data of Bell, and there is insufficient good data from the present work, an attempt is made to correct for each forementioned error in Bell's data. Fig. 5.2 and Fig. 5.3 show all the corrections made on data with status ** and *** (see table 2.3). They are plotted on Fig. VI.6 of Bell's thesis (2, p.168) which shows (based on his theory) the variation of A T against TR for various a. The conclusion in this thesis is that no combinations of logical corrections on TR selections gives consistent value of "a." Fig. 5.4 shows only the data with *** status and for the assumption that only the correction of minus 4.4°F ( A, gauge correction) is necessary. The data as shown have a spread of "a" between a = 8 to 14. If we were to refer to Fig. 2.3, it would seem that the data shown on Fig.5.4 are higher than the "true" data in the order of 10°F (attributable to AT- corrections(i) and (ii)). With this approximate subtraction of 10°F, "a" has a spread between 12 and 20. Based on the above evidence it appears that "a" is not a constant for fast neutrons of one energy spectrum. Also "a" seems to have different values for fission fragments and for fast neutrons. 5.1.3 PWR Applications, Fig. 5.5 to 5.8 show the plotting of various cases considered in this work. The line labeled "Bergles-Rohsenow Criteria for Incipient Boiling" is based on equation (B.1) and the criteria explained in Appendix B. This line marks the appearance of the first bubble on the cladding surface of the PWR and boiling progressively becomes vigorous in the region above this line. In the event of a temperature excursion in the PWR, the superheat temperature increases, and if the line denoting RIN (radiation induced nucleation) lies below

74 the Bergles-Rohsenow line for that particular system pressure, then RIN may well be the dominant phenomenon in initiating nucleateboiling, With reference to Fig. 5.5 to 5.8 again, the maximun cladding temperature of 657°F and the marked pressure of 2235 psia are values from WASH-1082 (24) Consider the case of fission neutrons. Fig. 5.5 shows the effects of 9.55 Mev and 17 Mev neutrons in water with a = 6.07 as per Bell prediction. It is seen that a RIN line is closer to the saturation line as the energy increases. RIN and incipient boiling are equally likely at about 655°F for 9.55 Mev neutrons with a = 6.07. Fig.5.6 shows that for a fixed neutron energy of 17 Mev, a RIN line is closer to the saturation line as "a" increases. For neutrons induced alpha particles, exactly the same qualitative features are present, as displayed on Fig. 5.7 and 5.8 show ing effects of energy and "a" respectively. Fig. 5.9 shows a plot of the fission neutron spectrum.) It is (10) seen that there is an abundance of fission neutrons with sufficient energy to make RIN important. However, the justification of interpreting the effects of the fission spectrum in the manner we have done is still open to discussion. Furthermore, the "a" value uncertainty for fission neutrons and alphas should be borne in mind. 5.2 Recommendations. Experimentally the following further work could be considered. (1) Fast neutron data. (a) Obtaining better fast neutron data by taking the following experimental precautions with the existing set up. 1) Holding the temperature ramp rates constant above the 
75.json
75 particular temperature threshold (with reference to plots of threshold superheat versus temperature ramp). 2) Keeping the upper and lower thermocouples at the same temperature thereby assuring that the bubble is at constant temperature. 3) Recalibrating the pressure gauge over the experimental period. (b) Modifications of the existing set up to ease experiment and to enable higher temperature range data to be taken. Three suggest- ions are noteworthy here. 1) Two separate temperature recorders may be used to register the upper and lower thermocouple temperatures. 2) Some form of thermostatic arrangement may be incorporated into the present heating system to ease the heater control. 3) A more reliable way to hold the bubble in place should be seriously considered. One way may be to increase the convection generating power in the chamber. (c) Testing of temperature ramp effect based on Bell's theory may be done by balancing various ramp rates with varying radiation intensity. No new radiation source is needed as intensity can be conveniently varied by varying the distance of the source from the bubble. (ii) The present experimental set up may be used for work on some organic liquids in exactly the same manner. Suitable experimental parameters (source energy, source intensity, bubble size) must be decided beforehand so that a suitable spread with "a" exists in a plot of superheat threshold versus system pressure. Suitable supporting and covering oil have to be 
76.json
76 found to suspend the organic liquid bubble. In the area of theory, the following are noteworthy. (i) The other Bell's data on fast neutrons in water for 55 psia and 95 psia may, together with any future data, be compared to Bell's theory by similar plots as in Fig. 5.2 to Fig. 5.4. (ii) The experimental and theoretical results for neutron-induced nucleation by E1-Nagdy (5) may be compared to the theoretical results of section 3.6 based on Bell's Energy Balance Method. Theoretical results for acetone can be obtained in the same manner as benzene. The properties (20)(13)(14) of organic liquids can be found from suitable references. (The enthalpy change of evaporation of acetone could not be found in the present survey). (iii) Based on the present results, the constant"a" theory seems to be unacceptable and the theory needs to be reformulated, Indeed, the basic Energy Balance Method should be re-examined, especially in light of the (1) work of Becker which the author consulted only at the end of his thesis work. A few words on Becker's theory is in place. Becker worked on neutron induced nucleation in di-ethyl ether and compared his experimental results with theoretical results which were obtained separately by an "Electrostatic Theory" and a "Thermal Thoery.' According to Becker, neither theory agreed with his experimental results. His Thermal Theory corresponds to Bell's Energy Balance Method. In comparing with Bell's equation (3.2) of section 3.1, Becker has 4/3 TC(N*13 Prbb/2 + - 411(r*)2Td0 dT + = 4E (5.1) 
77.json
77 Becker has neglected dissociation effects in the bubble. but has two extra energy terms-the second and third term. arises (together with the first term) from a consideration of the difference in thermodynamic potentials between the states at r = 0 and r = r*. TT is an entropy term associated with the heat which must be supplied in the production of the surface of the bubble which is non- recoverable. Becker also questioned the validity of some of the basic properties used in the analysis. He suspected that hrg. the enthalpy change by evaporation, may not be used for metastable equilibrium states (superheat), since hfg is defined for stable equilibrium only. (iv) In the application of Bell's theory to the PWR, further investigation on the effects of the fission spectrum on causing radiation induced nucleation in water under PWR conditions is necessary.

82 Appendix B Criterion for Incipient Boiling Bergles and Rohsenow (3) have developed a criterion semi-empirically for incipient boiling of water over a pressure range of 15 to 2000 psia which is 2.30 1.156 (9/A);=15.60 = P (tw-tsat) - p°.0234 ( B.1) where (a/A) is the heat flux required for incipient boiling in [ BTU-hr-1-ft-2] P is the system pressure in psia, and the wall and saturation temperatures are in °F. The qualification for this criterion is that the water is in contact with a heating surface (wall) which has a full range of cavities present for bubble growth. This forced-convection surface boiling condition is assumed to be met in the flow of water over the cladding surface of fuel elements in the Pressurised Water Reactor. So also is it assumed that the criterion is valid in the region of 2235 psia, as is justified by the small variation of the criterion curves with high pressure shown on (23) p.207, Figure 27 of Todreas and Rohsenow For the purpose of the PWR condition calculation, the heat flux was taken as 5.5x105 a value for the maximum heat flux in a PWR as typified in WASH-1082(244. Table B.1 tabulates pressure and superheat temperatures obtained through equation (B.1) over the range of interest here.
